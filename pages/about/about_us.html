            <h3> Ricardo Maldonado </h3>

            <p> Ricardo is a creator. He somehow can envision whole worlds down to their details and still keep that vision clear enough for others to share. As a co-creator of Kab, he uses his ridiculous pile of talent to foster community. Early on, he learned to perceive a person by

their character and not by their ethnic background, despite the negative influences from family and associates. He's one of the pioneers who won't leave a trail of negativity behind. </p>
