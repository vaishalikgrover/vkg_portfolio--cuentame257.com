      <h2>Meet the Spirits</h2>

      <p> This is a story about responsibility, environmentalism, war, religion, ethics, “coming of

age,” and learning to stand up for what is right despite ancient scriptural doctrine. The

world of Kab is a place inspired by the pre-Columbian cultures from the North, Central

and South American continents. The four spirits have unique powers that are crucial to

maintaining a habitable climate to sustain life.</p>

      <h2>The Reality of Kab: Mobilize and Educate</h2>

          <p class="real1">Each of Kab's main characters or "Spirits" represent a current issue in the world today. The world of Kab is reflective of South American, Mesoamerica and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p class="real2">Karau'i and her family's struggles with her government parallel the indigenous people of the Amazon and their struggle with the current Brazilian government ignoring their rights in the Amazonian river basin.</p>
